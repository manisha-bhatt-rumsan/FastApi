        The Solar System consists of the Sun and the celestial bodies that orbit it, including eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The Sun, a G-type main-sequence star, is the central and most massive object in the Solar System, accounting for 99.86% of its total mass. The planets vary greatly in size, composition, and distance from the Sun. For example, Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun, while Jupiter is the largest and has a massive gas composition.
